# Chrome-Dino-ClockMode
This set of console commands allows you to transform the Google Chrome browser's Dino game into a clock mode.

In the original game, players control a dinosaur character, skillfully navigating to evade obstacles such as cacti and pterodactyls, all while accumulating points.

Clock Mode transforms the distanceMeter that previously displayed scores into a representation of the current date in the `YYMMDD hhmmss` format.

## How to Use
1. Go to `chrome://dino` in the Chrome browser.
2. Before starting the game, open the console of Chrome DevTools. `(shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + j)`
3. Copy everything from the `main.js` file to the console, except for any parts you don't want.
4. Start the game, and you can go full screen using F11 if desired.

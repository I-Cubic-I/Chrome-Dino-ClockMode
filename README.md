# Chrome-Dino-ClockMode
This set of console commands allows you to transform the Google Chrome browser's Dino game into a clock mode.

In the original game, players control a dinosaur character, skillfully navigating to evade obstacles such as cacti and pterodactyls, all while accumulating points.

Clock Mode transforms the distanceMeter that previously displayed scores into a representation of the current date in the ```YYMMDD hhmmss``` format.

## How to Use
1. go ```chrome://dino``` on chrome
2. before play, open the console of Chrome DevTools. ```(shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + j)```
3. copy everything from main.js to the console except for the parts you don't want.
4. start the game. full screen via F11 if you want.
